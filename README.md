# NeuralNetwork
 Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and evaluated its performance in classifying handwritten digits. Also used the same network to analyse a more challenging face dataset and compared the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library. Python, Numpy, Scipy, TensorFlow
